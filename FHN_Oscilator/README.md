# Model:FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) Oscillators with Rotational Coupling (Eq.4)

Code: FitzHugh–Nagumo_Oscilator_on_single_layer_ring_network.jl

Input:   'φ' (phii)  : rotation angle of the coupling matrix ranging from [π/2-0.35 < φ < π/2 +0.35]

Output: Time Series of all N nodes in N (Only excitatory varriable u) x time (single or time window)

(Each node has two variables u,v, only u variable has been selected to display the figures)
