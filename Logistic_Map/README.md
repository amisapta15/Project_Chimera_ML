# Model: Coupled Logistic Map (Eq.6)

Code: Logistic_Map_Dynamics_on_Single_Layer_Regular_Network.cpp

Input:   'ϵ' (eps)  : overall coupling strength taken from the range [0 < ϵ < 1]

Time Series of all N nodes in N x time (single-time or snapshot) matrix. 

In the following, we write specific values of ϵ used to generate figures displayed in manuscript:

* **Fig 3a** depicting *Incoherent state* for coupled Logistic map for *φ = π/2 + 0.35* (Data File: Fig_3a.dat). Dataset for the traininng (table 1) and testing (table 2) ML algorithims are generated by using different initial conditions, considering states at different time-steps and changing φ values in the neibourhood of the value mentioned above.

* **Fig 3b** and **Fig 3c** depicts *Chimera state* for FHN Oscilators for *φ = π/2 - 0.1* (Data File: Fig_2b.dat), *φ = π/2 - 0.15* (Data File: Fig_2c.dat), respectively. Dataset for the traininng (table 1) and testing (table 2) ML algorithims are generated by using different initial conditions, considering states at different time-steps and changing φ values in the neibourhood of the value mentioned above.

* **Fig 2d** depicts *Coherent state* for FHN Oscilators for *φ = π/2 - 0.35* (Data File: Fig_2d.dat). Dataset for the traininng (table 1) and testing (table 2) ML algorithims are generated by considering states at different time-steps, and changing φ values in the neibourhood of the value mentioned above.
