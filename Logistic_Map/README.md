# Model: Coupled Logistic Map (Eq.6)

Code: Logistic_Map_Dynamics_on_Single_Layer_Regular_Network.cpp

Input:   'ϵ' (eps)  : overall coupling strength taken from the range [0 < ϵ < 1]

Time Series of all N nodes in N x time (single-time or snapshot) matrix. 

In the following, we write specific values of ϵ used to generate figures displayed in manuscript:
