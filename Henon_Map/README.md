# Coupled Henon Map

Code: Henon_Map_Dynamics_on_Single_Layer_Regular_Network.cpp

Input:   'ϵ' (eps)  : overall coupling strength taken from the range [0 < ϵ < 1]

Time Series of all N nodes in N x time (single-time or snapshot) matrix. 

In the following, we write specific values of ϵ used to generate figures displayed in manuscript:

* **Fig 4a** depicting *Incoherent state* for coupled Henon map for *ϵ = 0.1* (Data File: Fig_4a.dat). Dataset for the traininng (table 1) and testing (table 2) ML algorithims are generated by considering states at different time-steps and changing ϵ values in the neibourhood of the value mentioned above.

* **Fig 4b** and **Fig 4c** depicts *Chimera state* for coupled Henon map for *ϵ = 0.26* (Data File: Fig_4b.dat), *ϵ = 0.3* (Data File: Fig_4c.dat), respectively. Dataset for the traininng (table 1) and testing (table 2) ML algorithims are generated by considering states at different time-steps and changing ϵ values in the neibourhood of the value mentioned above.

* **Fig 3d** depicts *Coherent state* for coupled Henon map for *ϵ = 0.7* (Data File: Fig_4d.dat). Dataset for the traininng (table 1) and testing (table 2) ML algorithims are generated by considering states at different time-steps, and changing ϵ values in the neibourhood of the value mentioned above.
