# Model:Kuramoto Oscillator (Eq.1)

Code: Kuramoto_Oscilator_on_single_layer_regular_network.jl

Input:   'α' (alpha) : phase lag parameter (Eq.1) taken from the range [0 < α < π]

Output: Time Series of phases of all N nodes in N x time (single-time or snapshot) matrix. All phase values are wrapped (mod 2π) in the [-π,π] envelop. 

In the following, we write specific values of α used to generate figures displayed in manuscript:

* Fig 1a depicting Incoherent state for kuramoto Oscilators for α = 0.2, Data File: Fig_1a.dat. Dataset for the traininng (table 1) and testing (table 2) ML algorithims are generated by using different initial conditions, considering states at different time-steps and changing α values in the neibourhood of the value mentioned above.

* Fig 2b depicting Chimera state for kuramoto Oscilators for α = 1.4, Data File: Fig_1b.dat. Dataset for the traininng (table 1) and testing (table 2) ML algorithims are generated by using different initial conditions, considering states at different time-steps and changing α values in the neibourhood of the value mentioned above.

* Fig 2c depicts Chimera state for FHN Oscilators for α = 1.5, Data File: Fig_1c.dat. Dataset for the traininng (table 1) and testing (table 2) ML algorithims are generated by using different initial conditions, considering states at different time-steps and changing α values in the neibourhood of the value mentioned above.

* Fig 2d depicts Coherent state for FHN Oscilators for α = 1.65, Data File: Fig_1d.dat. Dataset for the traininng (table 1) and testing (table 2) ML algorithims are generated by considering states at different time-steps, and changing α values in the neibourhood of the value mentioned above.
