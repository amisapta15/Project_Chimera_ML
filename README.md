## Model:Kuramoto Oscillator (Eq.3)

Code File: Kuramoto_Oscilator_on_single_layer_regular_network.jl

Input: alpha, the phase lag parameter ('α' in Eq.3), taken from the range [0 < α < π]

Output: Time Series of phases of all *N* nodes in [*N* x 1] vector for a particular time-step in the steady state. Note that, in the code, all phase values are wrapped (mod 2π) in the [-π,π] envelop. 

In the following, we write specific values of α for generateing figures of the manuscript:

* **Fig 1a** depicting *Incoherent state* for kuramoto Oscilators for *α = 0.2* (Data File: Fig_1a.dat). Different [*N*x1] vectors, used for the traininng (table 1) and testing (table 2) ML algorithims, are generated by using different initial conditions, by considering states at different time-steps and by changing α values in the neibourhood of the value mentioned above.

* **Fig 1b** and **Fig 1c** depicting *Chimera state* for kuramoto Oscilators for simulated for *α = 1.4* (Data File: Fig_1b.dat), *α = 1.5* (Data File: Fig_1c.dat), respectively. Different [*N*x1] vectors, used for the traininng (table 1) and testing (table 2) ML algorithims are generated by using different initial conditions, by considering states at different time-steps and by changing α values in the neibourhood of the value mentioned above.

* **Fig 1d** depicts Coherent state for kuramoto Oscilators for α = 1.65 (Data File: Fig_1d.dat). Different [*N*x1] vectors, used for the traininng (table 1) and testing (table 2) ML algorithims are generated by considering states at different time-steps, and changing α values in the neibourhood of the value mentioned above.

## Model:FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) Oscillators with Rotational Coupling (Eq.4)

Code File: FitzHugh–Nagumo_Oscilator_on_single_layer_ring_network.jl

Input: phii, the rotation angle of the coupling matrix ('φ' in Eq.5), taken from the range [π/2-0.35 < φ < π/2 +0.35]

Output: Time Series of all N nodes in [*N* x 1] vector for excitatory varriable u, at a particular time-step in the steady state. Note that each node has two variables u,v, only u variable has been selected to display the figures, resulting in N time series.

In the following, we write specific values of φ for generating figures in the manuscript:

* **Fig 2a** depicting *Incoherent state* for FHN Oscilators for *φ = π/2 + 0.35* (Data File: Fig_2a.dat). 

* **Fig 2b** and **Fig 2c** depicts *Chimera state* for FHN Oscilators for *φ = π/2 - 0.1* (Data File: Fig_2b.dat), *φ = π/2 - 0.15* (Data File: Fig_2c.dat), respectively. 

* **Fig 2d** depicts *Coherent state* for FHN Oscilators for *φ = π/2 - 0.35* (Data File: Fig_2d.dat).

Code File: Logistic_Map_Dynamics_on_Single_Layer_Regular_Network.cpp

Input: eps, the overall coupling strength ('ϵ' in Eq.6) taken from the range [0 < ϵ < 1]

Output: Time Series of the state variable for all N nodes in [*N* x 1] vector at a particular time-step in the steady state.

In the following, we write specific values of ϵ for generating figures in the manuscript:
